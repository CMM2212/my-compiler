/**
 * Helper class to keep track of the current state of the lexer, and track information useful for
 * error messages.
 *
 * This class is responsible for keeping track of line, position, and token length information
 * related to what the lexer is currently processing. Each time the lexer processes a character, it calls
 * the advanceChar method to update the state of the lexer. Additional methods such as incrementTokenLength and
 * endLine are also used to update the state of the lexer.
 *
 * This information is used by the lexer when it needs to generate error context information during
 * exception handling.
